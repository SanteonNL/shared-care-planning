# Authentication in SCP

## The principles behind the auth. model

- The ORCA process is initiated by a user who must be identified as an authorized user.
- If the process spawns multiple systems, the user identity included/forwarded in such a way that the other systems must be capable of verifying the identity.
- The identification of the user must be verifiable, if not, the trust relationship must be made clear.
