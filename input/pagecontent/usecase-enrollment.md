# Enroll patient in home monitoring

A cardiologist, Janique de Boer, from Hospital X diagnoses heart failure for patient Jean Jacques van Putten and explains about home monitoring with Zorg bij jou and gets implied consent from Jean Jacques to enroll him in this.

Janique checks with Jean Jacques if all criteria for enrollment are met: he has a smartphone, he reads email on smartphone, he can install apps on smartphone, he is proficient in Dutch language and that he is in possession of scales and a blood pressure meter. 

Janique clicks on the ‘Enroll for home monitoring”-button in EHR to enroll Jean Jacques. A pop-up window appears. In the window, firstly, a CarePlan is to be selected for Jean Jacques. A check is done on if a CarePlan already exists internally in Hospital X, but also externally in the CarePlan Service.

A CarePlan does not exist, therefore it should be created. To do so, Janique clicks on “Create CarePlan” button. Patient (BSN) and Condition details are now taken from the EHR and a CarePlan gets created. 

The newly created CarePlan can now be selected to continue the enrollment. 

With selection of the CarePlan, Janique can now provide further information in a questionnaire required for the enrollment process. For the patient: name (Jean Jacques van Putten), gender (male), date of birth (12-7-1956) and contact information (phone-number 06-12345678 and e-mail address jj.van.putten@gmail.com) is populated; heart failure is selected from the conditions known in the CarePlan; and, requestor (Janique de Boer from Hospital X) and performer (Zorg bij jou) details are populated. 

The name and requester information are populated automatically. The condition can be selected from a dropdown; since heart failure is the only condition known for Jean Jacques, the dropdown is also populated automatically. Since Zorg bij jou is the only organization where home monitoring is performed for Hospital X, also the performer is selected automatically.

Janique has to click “Order” and the “Task” is sent to Zorg bij jou including all the information provided. Zorg bij jou automatically accepts the tasks and provides a direct task status update, so Janique can see that the task is received and subsequently accepted. 

Janique monitors the task in the EHR and sees that a few days later the status of the Task is updated to “in progress”, meaning that Jean Jacques has downloaded and started to use the monitoring app.
